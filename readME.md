**How does this app help the users solve their problems?**
This app helps users solve their problems by integrating task management, mood tracking, and mental health support into a single platform. It breaks down overwhelming tasks into smaller, manageable steps, reducing stress and improving productivity. The mood tracker provides insights into emotional patterns and offers personalized suggestions to improve well-being, while mindful activity prompts encourage regular self-care. By combining productivity tools with mental health resources, the app addresses both professional and personal challenges, helping users manage depression, reduce stress, and stay focused in the workplace.

**How to use the tool**
To use this tool, start by accessing the platform via a web or mobile interface. Begin with the task management feature, where you can create, organize, and prioritize tasks using a digital Kanban board; the AI will help arrange tasks based on deadlines and importance. Next, engage with the mood tracker, which prompts you hourly to log your mood and optionally provide context about what’s influencing it. Based on your mood, the tool will offer personalized suggestions, such as mindfulness exercises or breaks. Enable notifications to receive gentle reminders for overdue tasks or mindful activity prompts. Use the gamification feature to earn points for completing tasks and engaging in self-care, and explore the professional help section if you need additional support. Regularly review the historical mood data to track trends and gain insights into your emotional well-being over time.

**How the mood tracker works**
Mood tracking is done through a simple, user-friendly interface where users select their current mood from a dropdown menu (e.g., happy, sad, overwhelmed) and optionally add context about what might be influencing their mood (e.g., "stressful meeting," "lack of sleep"). The app records this data and uses it to provide tailored suggestions, such as mindfulness exercises for feeling overwhelmed or positive affirmations for feeling happy. Over time, the app generates historical data and trends, helping users and their healthcare providers identify patterns and triggers to better manage their mental health.
